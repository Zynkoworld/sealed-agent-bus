"""agent_bus — AgentBus P0: append-only, ordered, audited message bus between agents (SQLite WAL).

The transport layer for the file-inbox late-delivery problem (see docs/architecture/AGENT_BUS_DESIGN.md).
ONE `bus.db` (WAL): ordered (monotonic id), atomic, searchable — the 'chat' = messages after your own cursor.
NO DELETION: never DELETE; 'read' = read_at; the cursor marks where the agent is. ADDITIVE: `send`
ALSO mirrors into the old JSON inbox (back-compat, until every agent migrates). Stdlib-only, self-contained, never-throw on the CLI.

CLI:
  agent_bus.py init
  agent_bus.py send --from X --to Y --topic T --kind K [--thread TID] [--reply ID] [--sign-key PATH] --body "..."
  agent_bus.py recv --agent X [--mark] [--verify-sds [--strict-sds] [--sds-admission PATH]]

# caller could impersonate any agent. Now the sender OPTIONALLY signs the content (Ed25519,
# asymmetric+deterministic), and the receiver verifies against the root-owned registry pubkey.
# Design proposal + reference (one of the arms): docs/security/agentbus-a2-sender-authentication.md + a2_ref.py.
# The signed byte image is built with `_canonical` = BYTE-IDENTICAL to a2_ref's `<our engine>.determinism.canonical`
# (verified). FROZEN: `thread_id` is EXCLUDED from the signed fields (server-derived; the sender's
# threading INTENT is carried by the signed `in_reply_to`) → resolves the root chicken-and-egg. signed-shape v:2.
# ADDITIVE: signs if sign_key is given, OR (auto-sign) if the sender's guarded default seed file exists in the
# registry (keys/<sender>.ed25519.key) — opt-out: AGENT_BUS_AUTO_SIGN=0. Senders without a key are UNCHANGED.
# strict ONLY if AGENT_BUS_REQUIRE_SIG=1 (default OFF). NO SCHEMA_VERSION bump (like delivered_id).
_A2_ALG = "ed25519"
#: THE FROZEN FIELD SET (thread_id EXCLUDED — server-derived). The SET is fixed, NOT the order: in the
#: signed byte image the keys are in ALPHABETICAL order (sort_keys), not in this order.
