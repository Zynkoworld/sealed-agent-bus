"""bus_ssh_exchange — SSH TRANSPORT between machines: the force-command endpoint of the RECEIVING machine (v1.2).

Model (the July SSH bridge, generalized): the remote agent SSHes OUTWARD to the bus machine (client-initiated,
through NAT, NO port opened on the remote machine). SSH provides encryption + client-key authentication; on the bus machine
the authorized_keys line is `command="… bus_ssh_exchange.py <identity>",restrict,…` → this script runs, NOTHING ELSE
(no shell, pty, port forward). See bus_ssh_enroll.py.

One SSH call = one atomic exchange round (stdin JSON → stdout JSON):

    in:  {"ack": <last stored reply id | 0>,
          "messages": [{"to", "body", "topic"?, "kind"?, "thread_id"?, "in_reply_to"?}, …],
          "attachments": [{"descriptor": {…}, "chunks": [{"sha256","seq","last","data"}, …]}, …]}
    out: {"identity", "protocol", "accepted": [bus-id…], "rejected": [{"index", "reason"}…],
          "attachments": [{"sha256", "status": "stored|partial|rejected", "reason"?}…],
          "replies": [{"id","ts","sender","topic","kind","thread_id","in_reply_to","body","sds"?}…]}

Security boundary:
- **The identity comes from the force-command ARGUMENT** (bound to the key), NEVER from the payload: the
  `from`/`sender` fields are ignored (anti-spoof).
- **Size ceilings:** the whole stdin ≤ MAX_BYTES; messages/round ≤ MAX_MESSAGES; the body gets the bus's own 64 KB cap.
- **sds-envelope passes:** the bus `send` checks the frame; the envelope's SIGNATURE is checked on the receiving side by the v1.1
  `recv --verify-sds` path — the `sds` field in the replies gives this label.
- **This endpoint does NOT sign the bus row** with the bus machine's key (AUTO-SIGN off): the remote sender's authenticity comes from
  the SSH key, the content's from the sds-envelope's own signature.
- **v1.5.2 — client-signed row:** a message may carry `ts`/`sig`/`pubkey` (with the sender's OWN Ed25519 key, in the bus's
  `sign_for_send` shape); the endpoint checks it against the registry key and stores exactly that → the recipient
  sees it as `signed` in product mode. A bare row under a name PINNED in the registry in product mode: `rejected` with a reason
  (`unsigned-pinned`) — it is not stored only to be silently dropped on read.
- **At-least-once delivery:** replies go out with PEEK; the cursor steps only on the client's `ack` in the NEXT
  round (if SSH breaks, nothing is lost). stdlib-only."""
