"""bus_notary — NOTARY LOG at the transport boundary (AgentBus v1.5).

Why: of v1.4's residual risks, two are not closed by the bus's own tools:
  (a) backdating WITHIN THE WINDOW (the signer chooses ts — the partner arm's B2 finding; the enforcement window
      protects delivery, it does not prove the time), and
  (b) whoever can write the bus DB can also rewrite the replay trace — the hash chain only makes that visible.
The notary log records the FACT of receipt at the boundary (bus_ssh_exchange, bus_relay), on the receiver's clock, in a hash chain,
with a periodic checkpoint signed by the notary's Ed25519 key — and BOTH parties can download and compare it.
It does not prove the message is true, but WHEN and FROM WHOM (authenticated identity) WHAT (hash) ARRIVED.

Entry (one JSONL line, `type: "entry"`):
    {seq, prev_hash, received_at_ms, envelope_sha256, sender_identity, sender_auth, recipient, kind,
     decision: "accepted"|"rejected"|"delivered", reason, claimed_ts_ms}
  - OUTBOUND direction at the SSH boundary: `kind="ack"` (reason "cursor A->B (ack U)"), `kind="pickup"`
    round entry (decision accepted, reason "cursor=C replies=N") and per reply `kind="pickup"`, decision `delivered`
    (envelope_sha256 = the JCS hash of the delivered reply dict). All written BEFORE the side effect.
    entry_hash = sha256(JCS(entry without entry_hash))
  - `sender_auth`: "ssh-key" (force-command identity) · "pickup-sig" (signed pickup) · "unauthenticated-claim"
    (the relay /deliver `from` field — not authenticated, hence labelled so)
  - NEVER contains the plaintext of an encrypted envelope: only hash + metadata.
Checkpoint (`type: "checkpoint"`): {seq, head_hash, ts_ms, notary_pub, sig} — sig = Ed25519(JCS(the part without sig)).

Offline verification (either party): `verify` recomputes the chain (rewrite → wrong entry_hash at that seq;
deletion → seq gap; reordering → non-increasing seq / prev_hash break), checks the checkpoint signatures and whether the
head_hash matches; it measures `claimed_ts_ms` (the sender's claimed time, normalized to ms) against `received_at_ms`: anything older than the window is `backdated-claim`
(EVIDENCE, not a silent drop). `compare A B` compares two parties' exports over the shared seq range, byte for byte.
IMPORTANT: a seq gap only proves deletion of an ALREADY WRITTEN entry; an entry never written leaves no gap. Protection against
omission is the sender-side comparison: `reconcile` (the remote party's receipt list — messages sent, replies
received, acks sent — vs. the log).

Mode: in product mode (bus_enforce.mode()) ON by default, and fail-closed: without cryptography or a notary key the
logger does not start → the boundary rejects. In dev mode OFF by default (back-compat); `AGENT_BUS_NOTARY=on|off` overrides
(it CANNOT be switched off in product mode). stdlib (+cryptography for signing)."""
